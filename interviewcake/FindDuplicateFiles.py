"""
Copied from Interview Cake

You left your computer unlocked and your friend decided
to troll you by copying a lot of your files to random spots all over your file system.

Even worse, she saved the duplicate files with random,
embarrassing names ("this_is_like_a_digital_wedgie.txt" was clever, I'll give her that).

Write a function that returns a list of all the duplicate files.
We'll check them by hand before actually deleting them,
since programmatically deleting files is really scary.
To help us confirm that two files are actually duplicates, return a list of tuples â†´ where:

the first item is the duplicate file
the second item is the original file
For example:

[('/tmp/parker_is_dumb.mpg', '/home/parker/secret_puppy_dance.mpg'),
 ('/home/trololol.mov', '/etc/apache2/httpd.conf')]
You can assume each file was only duplicated once.
